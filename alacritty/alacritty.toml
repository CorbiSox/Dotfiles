# $HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml
# by Rito Ghosh 2023-10-06

# Alacritty now uses TOML formatting for its config files.
# This is a simple example.

# There are the specification here: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/extra/man/alacritty.5.scd
# It is not obvious how it translates to TOML. But it is extremely straightforward.

# example: WINDOW, COLORS, etc. are tables, and should be represented as [window], [colors], respectively.
# specifics of variables go under them. e.g.- look under "dynamic_padding" under-
# https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/extra/man/alacritty.5.scd#window
# write `dynamic_padding = true` (without backticks -`) under the table [window]
# for variables with multiple values, use "dotted keys". Like setting `padding.x = 5` under [window].
# This is simple. If not clear, do several trials and errors.

# Below is my initial set-up. The TOML homepage (https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0) was very helpful in figuring this out. 
# I put the file alacritty.toml in $HOME/.config/alacritty. However it can be kept anywhere among the places mentioned in
# https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/tree/master#configuration

[window]

opacity = 0.8

# padding.x = 10
# padding.y = 10

# decorations = "Full"
# decorations_theme_variant = "Light" # "Dark"

[font]
# Set the default font family to Fira Code
normal = { family = "Hack", style = "Regular" }

# Adjust the font size (in pt)
size = 10.0

# Optional: You can specify bold and italic styles as well
bold = { family = "Hack", style = "Bold" }
italic = { family = "Hack", style = "Italic" }

# Optional: Font size for bold text
# bold_size = 12.0

# Optional: Line spacing
# line_spacing = 0.0

# Optional: Offset to tweak text alignment
# offset = { x = 0, y = 0 }

# Optional: DPI scaling
#dpi = 96.0

# Tip: for inspiration, look for values in the source code files of your favorite VS Code themes, and use the color picker in
# Google to test colors before setting a value, or simply using an editor such as VS Code where colors are displayed in a 
# small box when a HEX is detected by the editor.
